# Gest Who!

This game is played by two (a selector and a guesser) and its rules are simple. Given a predetermined set of characters, the selector chooses one character from the set and keeps their choice secret. The diviner must then ask a series of yes or no questions to the selector as to the characteristics of the chosen character. When there is only one character remaining corresponding to the determined characteristics, the diviner asks if it is indeed the selected character. The goal of the diviner is to identify this character by asking as few questions as possible, while the selector has a rather passive role.
